 Step 1: Installation & Activation

   1. Ensure the golfvista-challenge plugin folder is located in your /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
   2. Navigate to Plugins -> Installed Plugins in your WordPress dashboard.
   3. Find "Golfvista Brain & Beauty Challenge" in the list and click Activate.

  Step 2: Configuration

  Before users can participate, you need to configure the plugin settings.

   1. Create the Entry Fee Product:
       * Go to Products -> Add New.
       * Create a product named "Challenge Entry Fee".
       * In the "Product data" section, check the "Virtual" box.
       * Set the "Regular price" to 25000 (or your desired entry fee).
       * Publish the product.
       * Edit the product again and look at the URL in your browser's address bar. Find the post= number. This is the
         Product ID. For example, if the URL is .../post.php?post=123&action=edit, your Product ID is 123. Note this ID
         down.

   2. Configure Plugin Settings:
       * Navigate to Settings -> Golfvista Challenge.
       * Main Settings Tab:
           * Sightengine API User: Enter your API user key from Sightengine.
           * Sightengine API Secret: Enter your API secret key from Sightengine.
           * Challenge Product ID: Enter the Product ID you noted down from the WooCommerce product in the previous
             step.
       * Quiz Settings Tab:
           * Fill in the fields for up to 6 questions.
           * For each question, provide a single, corresponding keyword that the user's answer must contain to be
             correct.
       * Click Save Changes.

  Step 3: Create the Challenge Page

   1. Navigate to Pages -> Add New.
   2. Create a new page titled "Brain & Beauty Challenge" (or any title you prefer).
   3. In the page content editor, add the following shortcode:
      [golfvista_challenge]
   4. Publish the page. This page will now serve as the main portal for the entire challenge, dynamically updating for
      each user based on their progress.

  Step 4: Managing the Challenge

   1. View Participants:
       * To see a list of everyone who has started the challenge and their current status (e.g., media_approved,
         quiz_passed), navigate to Business Plans -> Participants.

   2. Review Business Plans:
       * When a user successfully passes the quiz and submits a business plan, it will appear as a new entry in the
         Business Plans section of your WordPress admin menu. You can review and manage these submissions just like
         standard blog posts.
       * You will also receive an email notification to the site's admin email address whenever a new plan is submitted.

  That's it! The plugin is now fully configured and ready for users. They can register on your site, visit the
  "Challenge" page you created, and begin the process.



  ----------------------


   Thank you for your submission! Your media has been received and is pending verification. You will be notified shortly.
  when images upload then showing this then what next and what result

✦ Excellent question. That message indicates that the automated part of the plugin has taken over. Here is a breakdown
  of what happens next and the two possible results.

  What Happens Next (The Background Process)

   1. Status Change: When the user uploaded their media, their status was changed to media_uploaded.
   2. Trigger AI Check: This status change instantly triggers a background task on your server. You and the user don't
      see this happen, but the plugin is now working.
   3. API Communication: The plugin sends the URLs of the 5 media files the user uploaded to the Sightengine AI
      detection service, using the API keys you provided in the settings.
   4. Analysis: Sightengine analyzes each file to check for signatures of AI generation.
   5. Receiving Results: The plugin waits for Sightengine to send back a result for all files.

  This entire background process is usually very fast, but it depends on the speed of your server and the Sightengine
  service. The user will be "pending verification" during this time.

  The Two Possible Results

  Based on the analysis from Sightengine, the plugin will automatically determine one of two outcomes:

  Result 1: Media is Approved

   * If... Sightengine reports that all 5 files appear to be original and not generated by AI.
   * Then... The plugin automatically updates the user's status to media_approved.
   * What the User Experiences:
       1. They will receive an email with the subject "Media Approved," congratulating them on passing the first
          screening.
       2. The next time they visit the challenge page, they will see the new message: "Congratulations! Your submission
          has passed the first screening. Please proceed to payment to enter the next stage of the challenge." This
          message will contain a link that takes them to the WooCommerce product page to pay the entry fee.

  Result 2: Media is Rejected

   * If... Sightengine reports that even one of the 5 files is likely generated by AI.
   * Then... The plugin automatically updates the user's status to media_failed.
   * What the User Experiences:
       1. They will receive an email with the subject "Media Rejected," informing them that their submission did not
          pass the originality check.
       2. The next time they visit the challenge page, they will see the message: "Unfortunately, your submission did
          not pass our originality check. Please ensure your photos and videos are not AI-generated and try again." This
          message contains a "try again" link. Clicking it will reset their progress, allowing them to upload a new set
          of 5 files.

  In short, that "pending" message is temporary. The system will automatically notify the user via email and update the
  challenge page to guide them to the next step, whether that is payment or re-uploading their media.
